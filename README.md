# Extract-Dataset-Sentences

Code to get the relevant sentences from papers. First run create_project_setup.py to get a similar file structure. This will create a similar file set up to the one I've been
using but of course you can change it if you want.

Then move onto to converting the PDFs from text using the process as detailed in the readme of the convert_using_cermzones folder. (convert, to_txt, extract_relevant_sections,
and then finally run sentences_broad.py to create csv files showing the sentences for each paper)
